My wonderful collegue, Bella Gerrard and I have recently published our investigation into the turbulence driving parameter of our favourtie Milky Way wind clouds. The work found that the clouds are in a mostly compressive mode, check out the paper for more details: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/530/4/4317/7660574?login=false">Turbulence statistics of HI clouds entrained in the Milky Wayâ€™s nuclear wind</a>.
