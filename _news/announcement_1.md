My wonderful collegue, Bella Gerrard and I led an investigation into the turbulence driving parameter of our favourtie Milky Way wind clouds. The investigation found the clouds to be in a mostly compressive state, representing a unique object in the mach number vs density dispersion space for our galaxy.
Check out the paper for more details: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/530/4/4317/7660574?login=false">Turbulence statistics of HI clouds entrained in the Milky Wayâ€™s nuclear wind</a>.
