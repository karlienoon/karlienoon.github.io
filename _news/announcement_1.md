Our paper, "Direct observations of the atomic-molecular phase transition in the Milky Way’s nuclear wind” was accepted for publication in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society journal. This paper is the first for my PhD. The paper can be accessed on the MNRAS website or on the ArXiv.
