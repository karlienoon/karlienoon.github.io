Our proposal titled "Characterising molecular gas in the nuclear wind of the Milky Way” was rated “A” and approved to observe on the IRAM telescope later in 2023. Our team will be continuing our investigation into the chemical state of cold clouds in the Milky Way wind by observing and analysing multiple molecular transition lines.
