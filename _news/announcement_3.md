I have been invited as a plenary speaker to attend the Asteroids Comets & Meteors Conference in Flagstaff, Arizona in June this year. I will be presenting on Indigenous sky sovereignty. For more information on the conference, <a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/acm2023/">check out their website</a>.
