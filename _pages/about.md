Karlie Alinta Noon is a proud Gamilaroi astrophysicist, science communicator, and advocate for Indigenous-led approaches to science and space exploration. As the first Indigenous woman in Australia to graduate with degrees in mathematics and physics, she has forged a path as both a researcher and public figure, combining cutting-edge astronomy with cultural knowledge. Her PhD research at ANU focuses on the chemical evolution of the Milky Wayâ€™s nuclear wind, blending multi-wavelength observations with advanced simulations.

Beyond academia, Karlie is a passionate storyteller, using her platform to amplify Indigenous voices in science and champion environmental stewardship in space practices. A co-author of <a href=" https://www.booktopia.com.au/first-knowledges-astronomy-karlie-noon/book/9781760762162.html">Astronomy: Sky Country</a> with a respected presence across digital, print, and broadcast media, she has been recognised for her leadership in embedding cultural knowledge into scientific discourse, demonstrating the transformative impact of Indigenous perspectives in shaping a sustainable future for all.
