With over a decade of experience in science communication, Karlie has used her experience in Indigenous heritage and STEM education to support the democratisation of STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths). Specifically, Karlie is interested in integrating Indigenous knowledge and values within modern day space and astronomy fields.
