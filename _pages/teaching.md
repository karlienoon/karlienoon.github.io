In 2021, Karlie worked alongside Kamilaroi astronomer Peter Swanton to create a series of lectures on Indigenous astronomy. The course explores the rich histories of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, notable Indigenous astronomical observations, the various applications of such observations and how Indigenous peoples care for country, including sky country. The lectures are apart of a first year astronomy course at ANU titled <a href="https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/astr1003"> Astronomy and Space</a>. Karlie acts as co-conveynor for the course where she assists with student requests and administration. Other topics covered in the course include space travel and colonisation, our solar neighbourhood and space law and space medicine. The course is available to students at the ANU and world-wide on the MOOC website.

Karlie has appeared as a guest lecture for many universities including University of Canberra, University of Southern Queensland, Monash University, and University of Newcastle where she regularly presents on topics including Indigenous knowledge systems and science communication.
