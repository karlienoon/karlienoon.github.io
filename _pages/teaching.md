In 2021, Karlie worked alongside Gamilaroi astronomer Peter Swanton to create a series of lectures on Indigenous astronomy. They explore the rich histories of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, notable Indigenous astronomical observations, the various applications of such observations and how Indigenous peoples care for country, including sky country. The lectures are apart of a first year astronomy course at ANU titled <a href="https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/astr1003"> Astronomy and Space</a>. Karlie acts as co-conveynor for the course where she assists with student requests and administration. Other topics covered in the course include space travel and colonisation, our solar neighbourhood and space law and space medicine. The course is currently only available to students at the ANU but will soon be available world-wide on the MOOC site in late-2023.

Karlie has also appeared as a guest lecture for many universities including University of Canberra, University of Southern Queensland, Monash University, and University of Newcastle where she regularly presents on topics including Indigenous knowledge systems and science communication.
